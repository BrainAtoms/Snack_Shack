# Snack Shack

## Description

Snack Shack is a recipe database that is very simple to use. A user will only need to access our URL at [Snack Shack](https://floating-reef-78228.herokuapp.com/). Once a user navigates to our site, they can view any recipe that is currently available. The real fun begins when a user creates and logs into their account. Once a user has an account, they will be able to upload a recipe directly to our database that will then be shared with other users!

## Installation

There is no installation for our project, the user will simply have to navigate to [https://floating-reef-78228.herokuapp.com/](https://floating-reef-78228.herokuapp.com/).

To create an account, the user will just need to create a username and password, as well as provide their email address.
